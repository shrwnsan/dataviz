## Data Processing Notes

### Methodology
1. **Primary Sources**: Direct data from official surveys and reports
2. **Secondary Analysis**: Cross-referencing multiple sources for validation
3. **Estimates**: Where direct data unavailable, conservative estimates based on proportional analysis
4. **Time Normalization**: Adjusting data to consistent time periods where possible

### Limitations
- Cosmos-specific salary data limited; estimates based on broader blockchain developer market
- Some usage frequency data extrapolated from available ecosystem metrics
- Private/proprietary development not captured in open-source metrics

### Data Quality Assurance
- Cross-validation across multiple independent sources
- Conservative estimates where exact data unavailable
- Clear attribution of all data sources
- Regular updates as new reports become available

## Updates and Revisions
- Last Updated: June 2025
- Next Scheduled Update: December 2025 (upon release of new Electric Capital report)
- Data Sources Reviewed: Monthly for salary data, Quarterly for ecosystem metrics
